# 📊 Linear & Logistic Regression Projects

Welcome to my repository showcasing foundational implementations of two essential supervised learning algorithms: **Linear Regression** and **Logistic Regression**. These projects are part of my journey in developing a strong grasp of core machine learning concepts.

## 🧠 Projects Included

1. **Linear Regression**
   - Predicts continuous outcomes based on input features.
   - Implementation includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation using metrics like RMSE and R², and result visualization.

2. **Logistic Regression**
   - Used for binary classification tasks.
   - Covers data cleaning, feature scaling, model fitting, confusion matrix, precision-recall analysis, and more.

## 📁 Files

- `Linear_Regression_Student.ipynb`  
- `Logistic_Regression_Student.ipynb`

Each notebook contains:
- Step-by-step explanations
- Python implementation using `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`
- Practical insights on model performance and interpretation

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib / seaborn

## 🔍 Purpose

These projects demonstrate my hands-on understanding of regression algorithms and my ability to implement ML workflows from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
